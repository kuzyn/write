i made wawa laugh once. more than once. thousands of times, yeah. there were fireflies like in a dream, some dying and some alive. our hands and knees dirtied up, then our whole naked bodies breaking twigs and moving pebbles. i grabbed a handful of soil in the deed's death, my right hand over her left shoulder. mineral nails and i looked in her eyes, what i could see of them at this hour, and we say twilight but it's justified only in this case and i would forget about all the other cases if we could only keep this one. my head resting flat on her stomach, seeing the swaying branches of a clear, maple canopy, we laid there like bait for the sun and it slowly came: the bats were gone, the flashlight and fireflies, the drunken laughs of others and our silent and inebriated conniving turned into laugh and dare, dare for anyone to come and see, to see with us how it made sense and how happy we were. i can only speak for myself, of course, but we were so very happy.
