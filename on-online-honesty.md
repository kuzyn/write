a big, big part of the online word depends on a a human impulse that is hard to fight against: honesty. it preys on it.

the internet was build on good faith. I am not talking about darpa or how the thing came to be, I am talking about the EFF, GNU, Linux, Tim Berner Lee, etc...
some strange hippy dream sidestepping all the hurdles and annoyances and pettyness and business interest of the actual world to create this new frontier,
oncemore westbound, where all is brutal, but possible. and once more we lost the west. to what? to the same people: telegraph lines and oil interests. anything
that makes a server a server. electricity and copper wires. copper will never be gold

a way to fight back, to be subversive, to be assertively contrariant in the modern world is to become dishonest online. i don't mean that facetiously; I am completely
earnest. good faith has been gutted out of the system my friends, bad faith is in. how much more do you wnat to comply with the people who are literally, and I mean that in every single since, literally, paying their childrens's future with your honest, goodfaithed participation?

we are not prisonners, we are willing complices. how many free reviews, endorsements, product placement shots, truthful feedback are you ready to leave for faceless, exploitation driven businesses? they ask you why an ad is wrong and you tell them. you are doing their job: where is your pay? using facebook is good enough? does that pay for rent? this is labor my friend. this product review that you leave on amazon serves amazon: where are your dividends? corporations have never been bigger, yet, they have never held so little assets, hired so little employees

how many hours will we squander away to pay for some asshole's yacht?

i am pleading with you, with myself: be as cryptic, as useless, as uninformative as possible when you are asked to participate in some company's assessement of how well are they managing to syphon the cents of your paycheck. do not be truthful! good faith is out. bad faith is in. data is gold and we are mining away, on our own time, for no one's profit but billionaires. their biggest win was to conflate all of the internet together: i added content to wikipedia so i might as well add some to flicker. fuck this shit

be disruptive an dishonest online. don't volunteer anything for free, except if you feel it is a cause that is worth it. this is the last mile. this is the last mile of marketing
