it's simple really
tell me were it hurts
tell me how
use a language that we have in common
that link your pain to my pain
any language really

use my warmt
my ringtone
to tell that it's me
that's how we build trust

i make you think
of emptying your aunt's apartment after she died
with sixty years worth of skip
of the way a vowel bent when said
by your 7th grade teacher
of something only you have experienced, in your mind, alone,
since forever

and if you take us
the billions
all put together
have we felt what you felt?
do we know what you know?

at some point we'll all have that phone number
at some point we'll all wear that shirt
at some point we'll all collapse into each others
and do truth
be truth
