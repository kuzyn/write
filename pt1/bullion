you make space
now
you make time

it's simple really
tell me were it hurts
tell me how
use a language that we have in common
that link your pain to my pain

use my warmt
my ringtone
my hair
to tell that it's me
that's how we build trust

i make you think
of emptying your aunt's apartment after she died
with sixty years worth of skip
of the way a vowel bent when said
by your 7th grade teacher
of something only you have experienced, in your mind, alone,
since forever

at some point we'll all have that phone number
at some point we'll all make that speech
at some point, we will all collapse into each others
and do truth
be truth

and if you take us
the billions,
put us all together
do we know what you know?

you got a secret
tell me your secret
