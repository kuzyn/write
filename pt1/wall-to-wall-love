i lay claim to this
everything out there
the orange leaves
the dead ferns
the ponies, rolling in the grass
the accents
the negligents

by the sea
by way of the sea
miles upon miles
crawlers & train tracks
glass panes, corrugated steel
river bed and rivieres

ten millions pounds
of skipping stones
of mine
of my own

the rust,
the act of traveling, the time it takes
the whole idea of traveling, its
history and implications, all the way
to the synapses

all the leaves, not just the orange ones
and all plants, all animal, words,
forests, mountains, faults, empties
everyone
good or bad or undefined
every body of water
every single sound that can be heard or not

things that stretch from me to you
or stand between
at any moment
is mine,
wall to wall
