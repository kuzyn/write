the world gives
and
the world takes

you were born grotesque
pink and wet

your self
not as much an accident
as an event devoid of causality
a function of cosmological entropy
or something

so the world gave you to us
so we can all be here at the same time
the big gift

and then, after a while
it will be your turn to offer the big gift
back to the world

you will be beautiful
or at least
grown
or at least
older

(most likely, hopefully, older than you are now)

trust that the world will take you back
happily
from a rusty nail
from work-related stress
from airplane parts, falling on you
always

your friend,
the world
