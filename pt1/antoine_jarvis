"we used to be friend,
then you stole my authentic vintage buffalo jeans jacket.
now i would't even take a drag off your smoke"

when a man with his face like a melted, tan boot
board your taxi going up north
when you are drenched and sad and broke
and say buddy can you give me a lift a couple of blocks up
you accept, you say yes
out of despair or boredom or something
and on the radio there is this song about the repenting, nagging boyfriend

donne-moi au moins ma chance
vois comme j'ai beaucoup chang√©

and the man with the leathery face is excited and SHOUTS:
EILLE CABBY MONTE LE VOLUME!
and screams in the cab and hug you and says PLUS FORT
and he sings so loud that he squints

donne-moi une petite chance

you can't help it
you start singing too, as loud as you can
looking into each other's eyes for the chorus

ALLEZ! 
tu dois me pardonner
et tout recommencer

and he says
you know what the single most important thing is in life?
smile. every morning you just have to smile.

broken teeth, drunken broken teeth
a deranged grimace
i though it was health or family or self-love

when you walk down south sad and broke and broken hearted
and a short man in the street comes over
and you see his rough face
like it's been dragged in hot sands for two months
says buddy you got the time?
and you say no and he says come on man
and you pull your phone, on the brink of tears from the heavies and loneliness
and you say it's une heure et dix and he says i don't speak faggot
i'm in the army you don't care you faggot?
go there and fuck some other faggot and live your life you got five years
and your mouth is open and why

then you put the two together and you realize that the dreams and the nightmares are random and random looks everywhere for love and joy because it can be anywhere anytime and there's a lot of it and only one of you
