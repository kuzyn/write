fear the bad puns
for they will hunt you
when you are old
and a caricature of yourself

fear yourself, for
after manking fun of the goatees
you will wear the goatees

cheat, lie, deceive, gamble
while the stakes are low
and prepare for the season of nothing

pay only the interest on your student loan
so that the enditured cycle is complete
