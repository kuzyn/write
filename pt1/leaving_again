i remember the day in
the border guy said welcome back
after i showed him my florida license

i remember the day out
i drove the five hours back
you walked in queens
your suitcase handle broke off
your sunglasses split in two
your eyes where gelatinous
literral trash fell from the sky
hit you in the head
goo dripping over your eyes
you slipped on the sidewalk
etc etc

leaving your former garbage city
to get to my current garbage city

whole lot of work goes into nothing
and nothing ever gets done
but i've always wondered if anything would happen
if i just stood in the middle of a butterfly garden
inside a car
in the big city
on a bed
with the right person
with the right people
by myself
at the right time
at the right place

still

as it turned out
the sinkhole that swallowed a man
who was never found
never will
the nightmare stuff
it turns out
it was in florida
and the man, a floridian
