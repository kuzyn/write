i remember the day in
the border guy said welcome back
after i showed him my florida license

i remember the day out
your suitcase handle broke off
your sunglasses split in two
your eyes where gelatinous
i drove the five hours back to new york with the rental
you walked in queens

literral trash fell from the sky
hit you in the head
goo dripping over your eyes
you slipped on the sidewalk
etc etc

leaving your garbage city
to get to my garbage city

lots of work goes into nothing
and nothing ever gets done

but i've always wondered if anything would happen
if i just stood in the middle of a butterfly garden
inside a car
in the big city
on a bed
with the right person
with the right people
by myself
at the right time
at the right place

still

but it turns out that the sinkhole that swallowed a man
who was never found
never will
the nightmare stuff
it turns out
it was in florida
and the man, a floridian
