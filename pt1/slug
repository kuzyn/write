after a blue dot event
at the royal drawing school

you say would a classy girl
fall on her ass picking up pennies
would a classy girl
make a grand in a night

i say of course not

i spill moussaka inside your bag
looking for your keys
then wash it out in the sink

you are telling me that we'll go to paris
and that we'll have caviar and vodka

well, darling,
you're talking to the slug that ate the patch
