bitter
this one time u outta believe me
i just sat at the bar at the noname bar
green walls and plants and wooden tables
and i just sat at the bar in front of the bartendenders, they were dressed UP
and i ordered old fashioned
over old fashioned
over old fashioned
and more
i can attest 
with math and and probabilities and logic
that i ordered more old fashioned than u ever did i a single sitting
and by the end of it i was bent out
non-recyclable
i just kept going, well over a hundred bucks (i knew i could walk home)
the joy of privilege
cissssss
whitttttte
i don't need to do the math
when i wanna get back
so there is this bar
that uvenever heard ov
the noname bar
and one day in the past
u find me sitting at the bar
drinking an old fashioned
drownibg in pastel green
with an edge
and i slouch
and i have hairs
male pants
tshirt
so when i walk home?
and u askmefor a cigarette?
and my voice is different?
and u beat me?
and when i post, my face is blue?
how does that work in a brain
how do the walls resist
fuck you, bigot
fuck you a million times
