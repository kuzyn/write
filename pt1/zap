one color of victory is creating enough for someone to do a phd on you
not an afternoon wikipedia edit
not a footnote
someone studying you for years
q&a
grants and fly-in interviews

go to sleep depressed
a flash and a pop outside your window
a bird or squirrel must have touched the wires
you look out in the alley the day after
but there is nothing
