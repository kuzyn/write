tivoli is a bar in lapland
but i'm out of going out.
yet there's no goal, no filter either
it's just me and the fingers
the bunch glued by cold but
that might be it. maybe

the loose bonds, no-ties are going out
like i care when it's just lust
when we're young and all that matter
is your face and your ass.
like a play. i guess it's ok
if you don't ever wake up or close
the curtain

go out in the dark two drinks in hands
and then you fuck.
and then you both win over the other.
i'd rather stay and long for what i don't have
or what i couldn't pack in my tiny suitcase:
quite spiritual, quite hopeful if you ask me.
(if i ask me)

time [stretch] while the white place clothes you in.
