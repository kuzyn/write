 met her first she was my teacher
 met her last at a swans show
 the night i was reunited
 with the crazy/beautiful and
 always
 fucking
 late
 dearest
 i introduced them both, it felt like a bow about to snap
a friend had told me about her screaming and banging on his
door in the middle of the night, wanting her then boyfriend, his then flatmate
it made her all the more interesting
she is the sharpness, was cutting people off with flawlessness

i'd look at the bookstore where that man was nice and helpful to her
sometime i'd see her through the window
i always wanted to ask her out, but i never wanted to face-confront her
her and terra (like anyone would believe someone called terra actually existing
in life) had the same kind of standoffish vibe, but also so gentle and resilent
and sharp

at the swans show, after i had introduced her to the always late c/b dearest
i introduced her as a magnificient poet and i asked her about
it
maybe i even said 'poet career' (i was well into my nervous breakdown)
she held her eyes and the silence --she mastered the tension and delivery--
and said, snickering, squinting
'there is no $$$'
