Likesgiving is a celebration where we all come together and give likes to celebrate the
preceding year. It is a day were you like absolutely everything that appears on your
feed: links to 9gags videos; updated profile pictures of long lost friends;
replies of replies. Literally everything that can be liked deserves a like.

It is also a way to be likefull to the Face Book initiative, by giving them the
data they need to keep the company afloat. This is a bit like those Wikipedia
fundraisers with Jimmy, but you do not have to spend none of your hard earned
money ;) Your likes are valuable, and by doing your part in giving them you 
insure the posterity of our beautiful project.

Your customer profile might feel a bit different after Likesgiving, like when
you put on new shoes. Don't
worry! Sooner than you can say ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ you will be back to your
cozy feed, and the stuff you truly care about will be one click away.

On this day, be likefull to each other, be likefull to the Face Book project, show that you care by
showing that you like.
