After seeing her once early in the fall, with Louis Mathieu and Marye, I went to the Main building once in a while, hoping to bump into her (without any succes ever). That night, she wrote my name on arabic on my hand and went out the door while I cried for her to leave me her number. She came back a minute later, scratching it into my arm with a lousy pen. And it was the first number I ever asked. She could see that it overwhelmed me and she immediately regretted :
“Oh fuck, you’re gonna freak out aren’t you? Please don’t freak out.”
And she hurried out the door so I couldn’t embarrass myself any further. 

I tried to ambush her, using the only information I had remembered at the time : she took Arabic classes at Concordia. I scanned the big board in the main building, trying to find the location and time of the finals. Luckily, there was only one and it was the week after. I wasn’t sure of what I would do once I got a hold of her, as pretty much everything I’d say would make me pass for a stalker. THe only memories I had of Terra was that she spoke fast, was really drunk, had light-brown hairs that reached her elbow, had a beige coat, gnawed on a plastic nicotine inhalator and had incredibly beautiful eyes. They were light blue and you felt like you could see stories come out of them, like those of an old person. She was about 3 years older then me in fact.

So, I missed work and went there, stood in the hallway, reading Everything is Illuminated if I recall right. I wanted to make sure not to miss my only chance to ever find this girl again, so I sat-down as soon as the exam started, in case she was a shitty student and would have bailed early from a car-wreck exam. So I stayed there, three hours, staring at everyone coming out. I shyly smilled to any girl coming out, worried that I might not even recognize her anyway.

When the classroom was empty, I went in to take a look. I expired and got a cigarette out, feeling great about myself, about having the guts and the courage to chase, to go after someone like that. Unfortunately it wasn’t meant to be.

Some months later, all was cold and white. While taxing between class and Concordia International (where I had applied for exchange), a small stature pass by me, busy, a hood on her head. It took me about two second to realize it was her, that girl I thought about for the past few months. The first number I had asked for. I didn’t have trouble recognizing her at all. And before that even crystallized in my brain, I turned some degrees to my right and just shouted, smiling.

“TERRA!”
She stopped in her tracks and paused before turning around, like she got caught walking out of a dark room not saying goodnight everyone.
“Oh my god, Sam.”
“You’re a fucking asshole, you gave me the wrong phone number.”
