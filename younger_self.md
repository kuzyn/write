the day you sent me that message, a few days ago
that very day i was thinking of you, no jokes.
i do often
listening to hot snakes, auto midnight album
good soundtrack for that scene:
almost bailing off your long board
almost seeing me on a bike
in berlin

i always envied how coolly you moved through space
countries and cities
how you could summon friends from anywhere

when i walked in the bar, the game turned strange
you looked completely stunned
completely stunned

i was trying my best too
in the middle of a nervous breakdown
not a figure of speech
a nervous breakdown 
that had followed me from our time in montreal
listening to pavement & grandaddy in the snow, walking home
you saw my place and said "don't your room makes you depressed?"
i think i said yes
it is such a blur

yet i remember that there was
kindness & affection
you would call me gato and i would kiss you

but by that time my panic attacks were so intense
that i'd walk out of the office and call the mental help hotline, shaking
someone on the other side telling me to breath
to slowly
calm myself

in those weeks, those months, i would look at trucks outside my house
certain they were here to take me
my brain felt like it had been melted
i had permanent vertigo

you came around and said
"you lack guts because you don't quit your job
and come to europe with me, there are ways"
i mentioned it to a therapist

how i wanted your life

i quit a month later anyway
went to europe a month later
anyway

when i waited for you at the station
i became so anxious
i guess it put me back in montreal
when i waited
when i slapped you not for being late, but because these were the only moments of warmth and blissfulness of that winter and you pretended that they were nothing, you pretended that they were gone to make a joke, and at that time they were the only things i had; my heart sank when i though you had left and i started crying, paid and left, only to bump into you on the sidewalk, with a smile that said "got you, silly"

did you see in my eyes how helpless i was?

in the park, that very hot day in berlin, looking for something that I did not even believe existed
i was so desperate,
i had been looking for jobs every days,
I wanted so bad to stay, my visa running out, ten thousand dollars in the hole
bet on myself,
bet on my new european life,
my european friends,
far from the ghosts of montreal,
i applied to at least a hundred jobs,
no interviews worked out,
nothing was enough. i realized that i had to go back after all,
after telling everyone that i was gone for good,
storing my stuff,
breaking my lease

this humiliation &
the humiliation of waiting

but what i really wanted to say, actually, was that i was so emotionally jacked up on that day
two years or so ago
i was filled with unexplained dread
thinking about what you wanted to tell me
wondered what it was
i thought it could only be bad

but then i look at that picture of us in the photobooth
and think it doesn't really matter
i had my guesses, my friend had their guesses
that you were married; that you were sick; that you were in love
truth is not so important in the past tense
i had my moments too

i guess i never get to the point of writing and deleting,
but i often think of you as well mariana

"like the trench" i would say in porto
we've grown up a bit haven't we?
