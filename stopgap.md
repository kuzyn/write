a story about: selfishness/selfconsumption, scope & closure, virtuality, looking for then overlooking help, indulgence in all its forms.

When he woke up there was a hole in his head where there used to be dreams and sleep. He turned around. He squinted down, flat on his stomach, looking at the grey carpet under him, under his bed. He saw little dots of color, crumbs and hair. The dots reminded him of when he was younger and he'd close his eyes trying to get to sleep but kinda teasing himself not to at the same time, and he'd see millions of tiny dots red and blue flashing and they'd be like, when you're looking at the sky and it's the milky way and you see that something is there, but you can't really stop your eyes on the individual stars because there are so many of them all being milky. But as soon as you move your big bulky beautiful head, there they are, billions and billions and billions.

There was some drooling, or damp breathing, on his cotton sheets. He just looked at the floor for one more moment, the fact that he was abled body and concious. In a couple of decade, sleep had slowly evolved from something that he did for fun and without any effort, to this scary pilgrimage into his own selfness and looking for things that maybe were there but most probably weren't his private garden of the soul and mind and heart. His was tired already and the only thing that was awake so far was apparently his sense of dread, his eyesight, the glands that make saliva and maybe his penis, maybe not. He sighted and turned his big beautiful head around, a big ol'180 back, looking at the ceiling. He felt like thinking about the ceiling as well but stopped himself, since he'd already bored himself once today by looking at the floor. His life was a succession of looking at more or less flat surfaces and depending of how close or how far they were, boring himself to death with either intrinsinct or gigantic details. Oh look, a wall. Oh, a painting. Oh, look the clouds. Oh a screen. Oh, someone face. Fuck this he muttered, and did a 180 back, powf, back to the floor. He fell asleep right away.

Since he ran a bit late, he held his shit in from his apartement to his office, waiting to be done with his commute to be his most vulnerable. In spite of this small secret, there was passion in his strut, a drive and assurance, a come hither kinda thing going on. But that was most days, most times, most everything about him. He was tall, big lips, long-ish hair, splashed himself with the barkiest perfumes, he smoked and talked very little. He didn't have too; he'd get most things without having to open up, just look and look, a little smirk, his blue eyes just there, like hanging ornaments on a beautiful head. It was not bulky after all, oh no; that must have been because it was morning: his jaw was strong and square and just hung there, again, like a piece of a christmas tree but not the flashy part, the overlooked and taken-for-granted base. In other words, his jaw was the base of his face. His bod was also great, in all the usual way (tanned, a couple of bad tats here and there) so no need to linger there.

He finally made it to work. Good for him! "Good for me" he thought, as he entered the sandwich shop.
