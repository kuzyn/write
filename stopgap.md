a story about: selfishness/selfconsumption, scope & closure, virtuality, looking for then overlooking help, indulgence in all its forms.

When he woke up there was a hole in his head where there used to be dreams and sleep. He turned around. He squinted down, head hanging past the mattress, stomach flat, looking at the grey carpet under him, under his bed. He saw little dots of color, crumbs and hairs. The dots reminded him of when he was younger and he'd close his eyes trying to get to sleep but kinda teasing himself not to at the same time, and in the inside of his lids he'd see millions of tiny dots red and blue flashing and they'd be like, when you're looking at the sky and it's the milky way and you see that something is there, but you can't really stop your eyes on the individual stars because there are so many of them all being milky. But as soon as you move your big bulky beautiful head, there they are, billions and billions and billions.

There was some drooling, or damp breathing, on his cotton sheets. He just looked at the floor for one more moment, the fact that he was abled body and concious was welcomed. In a couple of decades, sleep had evolved from something that he did for fun and without effort, to this scary pilgrimage into his own selfness and looking for things that maybe were there but most probably weren't or if they were, they were the bitteres fruits of his victory garden of the soul and mind and heart. His was tired already and the only awake thing so far was apparently his sense of dread and his eyesight. He sighted and turned his big beautiful head around, a big ol'180 degrees back, looking at the ceiling. He felt like thinking about the ceiling and seeing where that'd go, but stopped himself, since he'd already bored himself once today by looking at the floor. His life was a succession of looking at more or less flat surfaces and depending of how close or how far they were, boring himself to death with either intrinsinct or gigantic details. Oh look, a wall. Oh, a painting. Oh, look the clouds, makes me think of when I was 6, blah, blah. Oh a screen. Oh, someone face. Fuck this he muttered, and did a 180 back, powf, back to looking the floor. He fell asleep right away.

Since he ran a bit late, he held his shit in from his apartement to his work, waiting to be done with his commute to be his most vulnerable. In spite of this, there was passion in his strut, a drive and assurance, a come hither kinda thing going on. But that was most days, most times, most everything about him. He was tall, big lips, long-ish hair, splashed himself with the barkiest perfumes, he smoked and talked very little. He didn't have too; he'd get most things without having to open up, just look and look, a little smirk, his blue eyes just there, like hanging ornaments on a beautiful head. It was not too big or asymetrical or perfectly and boringly round: his jaw was strong and square and just hung there, again, like a piece of a christmas tree but not the flashy parts, the overlooked and taken-for-granted part: the base. In other words, his jaw was the base of his face. His bod was also great, in all the usual way (tanned, a couple of bad tats here and there, scars from doing kool stuff like playing pool or being drunk).
He finally made it to work. Good for him! "Good for me" he thought, as he entered the sandwich shop.

-Hey, you're a bit late dude
-Yeah
-Well, I end up havin to clean up the mess from yesterday while you take your sweet-ass time t'get here.
-Uh...
Dave went around the counter and walked back into the small room in the back, put on his working shirt and walked back straight to the main work counter, half-listening to the unplugged monologue of his manager. His manager was an ex-fellon with a gravely voice who introduced himself as Sarge, and had a goatee that read like a perverted Rorscharch test.
-You know and I know that CB and Jeff don give a shit about this sandwich shop, but sure do and I though you did. I really though you did. When I see you put togheter a number 4 or an "A. Tuna Meltzer", you seem to put your heart into it you know, I really see it. I pick up on that stuff, I'm very... what's the word...
Sarge turned on his side, projected the knife he was holding knife back into the mayo vat, then passed the sandwich to Dave, who in turn filled it with stuff that used to moo.
-I'm perceptive!" Sarge said, twisting his fat neck around and up. "And I know something has been on your mind dude, something has been gnawing at you and you can't shake it and it shows" Sarge pointed at the sandwich that Dave was making, which by that time had became completely vulgar and deconstructed. Then he lowered his voice "It fuckin shows dude. First sandwich of the day: you'd eat that? Look at it. That's not a "Moolin Rouge", it doesn't even look like a number 2... Dude, it doesn't even look like it's on the menu!" Sarge subtely looked at the customer who was absorbed by his handheld internet. Then, Sarge sighed and speaking even lower, closer: "Dave, Stop. Look at me, it does not even look like it's a goddamn sandwich". There was some pain in his voice, nothing overblown or tacky, just the kind of disapointement coming from someone who knows how things should be but is facing what they actually are.
-It's okay Dave, I didn't mean to shake the cage like that. Grab a coffee, take five minutes to arrive, I'll finish this. It's alright. It's alright.

When his shift was over, Dave went to the cornerstore down the street and bought a pack of cigarettes along with beer in a can. He walked a couple of blocks whit the beer in his hand, then at a cross-street took a left and entered a park. The park was small but had a beautiful light, very warm and forgiving. There was dense foliage and the grass was long, its blade wide and extremely green. In the middle was a little roundabout path circled by lilies, where a small fountain was placed. On each side of the fountain was a stone carved head of native american woman spitting water, as part of the fountain. He felt a sort of shameful wind brush his hansome face and hair, looked away and lit up a cigarette. He looked further, past the fountain, past the lilac trees and cedars. On the other side of the street was a brown brick building of about three stories. One of the window was open and the white curtain that was inside had been sucked out and was now half-out, floating in the warm breeze of the city. He took a long drag of his cigarette, looking at the round and formeless contours of the fabric, like someone's hair out a car window. Sometime he felt like he was so in the moment, so very in the moment, that it was painful, that his brain would not let him stand still in that moment long enough, than time was not suspended, not hanging anywhere, just fleeting and ever out of reach. Like looking at the stars or the points of light, that appears better when you're looking sideway but when you try to really see them, you just can't. You can't win, Dave thought. There is too much of _this_, and not enough of me. He had read an inscription online that proclaimed that the "struggle was real", and he aggreed with that, it was a pretty aggreable statement. Then, he also read that "you were not born to pay bills and die" and he was more ambivalent about this. Wasn't life a giant debt? 

The beer had sank him a bit, and when he had finished it he got up, threw it in the trashbin beside's the bench and started walking south towards his appartment. He looked at people, insistently, hoping to create a connection, a distraction on the sidewalk. A short white man in a blue suit walked towards him, his hand to his temple, talking out loud. There was real emotion there, between this man and his hand; the man was furious. Shouting and walking and moving his free hand like his was conducting. When he passed to his left, his elbow brushed against Dave, and he felt the cheap and textured polyester on the back of his hand. He then look on his right and there was dog shit on the ground, stale and somwhat dried. The tip of a shoe had smeared a print on the sidewalk. A handsome man passed him on his right and nearly avoid the shit. He wore pointy brown leather shoes and had a very nice perfume on, coarsed and smoky. He had short trimmed hair, a fitted white shirt with a low collar and a beautiful dark, even skin. His belt went all the way around and seamed made of alligator leather or some sort of reptile. A bit further was a guy in an apron, round and balding, smoking a cigarette. He hadn't even walked a bloc yet.
