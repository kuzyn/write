the world gives
and
the world takes

you were born grotesque
pink and wet as a ham

your causality the outcome
of national policies
religious belief
or maybe
"love"

your self
not as much an accident
as
a comically random non-event

so the world gave you to us and gave itself to you
so we can all be here at the same time
so our colors are more or less the same
the Big Gift

and then, after a while
it will be your turn to offer
the Big Gift
back to the world

you will be beautiful
or at least
grown
or at least
older

trust that the world will take you back
from a squirrel bite
or work-related stress
always

your friend,
the world
