from peckham queen's
up on lausanne street
through telegraph hill
the view is beautiful
there is a lot to take in
there are desert plants
and forever homes

how life would be from a hill for a while?
i think of this:
we're all waiting for a riddle
to get us mad in love
something we know already
like a password to our heart
your favorite something

maybe it's a painting that touches you
or a movie you really love?

i like music myself

you say "train across the sea" and I crumble
ready to settle

"the race is on" and i'm ready
to sell everything 
and to follow

"hungry heart"
yeah i love the boss

on the other side of the hill
coming down calm
big bright moon
symetrical

in london at night
listening to the breathing
everything flooded orange

endwell street
i get my tobacco
hug a sick luca on the couch
i'm feeling a lot better myself

endwell street
cheeky
