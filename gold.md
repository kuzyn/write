Samuel: Sun Dec 11 09:06:12 EST 2011:  

Moonlight glimmers, traintrack russles, was that sunrise, was that the West?

A bearded mask on a thin frame, waiting for where, waiting for when.

I'll kiss your boots, I'll serve you well, I'll taste the whip, I'll lend
myself.

Samuel: Sun Dec 11 09:07:58 EST 2011:  You fucking golden starfish.
