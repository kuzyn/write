i remember the day in
the border guy said welcome back
after i showed him my florida license

i remember the day out
your suitcase handle broke off
your sunglasses split in two
your eyes where gelatinous
i drove the 5 hours back to new york
you walked in queens

literral garbage fell from the sky
hit you in the head
goo dripping over your eyes
you slipped on the sidewalk
etc etc

leaving your garbage city
to get to
my garbage city

lots of work
goes into nothing
and nothing
ever gets done

but i've always wondered if anything would happen
if i just stood in the middle of a butterfly garden
inside a car
in the big city
on a bed
by myself
with the right person
with the right poeple
at the right time
at the right place

still
