walking in at 9pm on a sunday
sweat lined face
on a three day binge
he's looking rough
pulls out a dime bag
i really shouldn't

then gets technical

there is a lot i learned

he worked one summer for a for profit university
doing the books
an elaborate money laundering operation
for the russian mafia
for the congolese mafia
during which a salesman got kidnap
in sub-saharian africa
and the university didn't tell
any governement

he saw the wires go from one spreadsheet to another
then
on his very last day
the cfo came in and she said
he's been freed
and everyone cheered

poor lad
