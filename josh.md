walking in at 9pm on a sunday
sweat lined face
on a three day binge
he's looking rough
pulls out a dime bag

i really shouldn't
he says
then gets technical

there is a lot i learned

he worked one summer for a for profit university
doing the books
an elaborate money laundering operation
for the russian mafia
for the congolese mafia
during which a salesman got kidnapped
in sub-saharian africa
and the university didn't tell any governement

he saw the wires go from one spreadsheet to another
then
on his very last day
the cfo came in and she said
he's been freed
and everyone cheered

then i did more learning

i tried to pass it casual
he said, asking for a napkin
didn't want you to freak out
i didn't crush it so well

poor lad
