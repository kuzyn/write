Cauz I liked the name best

The boss had a large, flat, creased face, dark brown dkin, a low voice. He had a small bar in the corridor leading to his assistant then to his office. They used words like "bullpen", "leads", "office goodies". They refered to me joining the company as an "intake". It was corporate's corporate America. There were lizards on the sidewalks, they put me in a hotel for two hundred dollars a day and my dinner was three bourbon, one cigarette and minibar snacks.

I dreamed that I was doing the same thing, again and again, never recalling it like an amnesiac. It's a recurrent dream. My brother was there, and I could sense the disapointement and hope within him and I felt so lost and fragile. I woke up through the night.

I told him that you gotta break'em in early and I still had no booze in me, which is a testament to my repartee.

Then the day of the Killing, I was listening to the zombies, drinking in my room, looking at apatement listings.
