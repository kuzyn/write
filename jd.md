"hello"
shake hands firmly a good handshake
thick voice
"I'm Jim Daily."
"hi im sam"

(at this moment JD realised that I didn't matter in the grand scheme of things)

and it turns out that the sinkhole that swallowed a man
who was never found
never will
the nightmare stuff
it turns out
it was in florida
and the man, a floridian
