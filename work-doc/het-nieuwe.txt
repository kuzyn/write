Occultism in digital culture

Arguably, the idea of the occult appeared somewhat in parallel to the notion of science.
Afterall, both offer an understanding of the world through a lense. 

They are linked not as much by their domain than by their causality: hard sciences
blew over the fog of mysticism, maybe even the sense of wonder, that came with a more
aproximative understanding of the world. Classical occultism
had as much to do with metaphysics as it did with the "hidden world": it is a 
creative interpretation of things that ellude momentary interpretation. The symptom
of a force that is witnessed, but not yet explained. The exponential growth and ubiquity of
computational devices allowed a similar understanding of the virtual world to appear: 
etheral, omnipresent, equally charged with infinite potential for fortune and retribution. 

We are in a transitory period with regard to new media & digital culture. In front of a massive, 
monolitic "cloud", our understanding falthers but our lives become condusive to
what can aptly be described has "the weirdness". The same weirdness that astrophysists
refer to when the talk about event horizons. This manifest itself in many different forms:
an image board effectively coordinating an artillery strike in Syria(1); a single company's
algorithm controlling 6 trillions dollars in assets(2); a 20-something serving a life sentence
without parole for creating an online marketplace(3). These are only figments of a broader 
narrative that I want to investigate with the assistance of the HN institute.

The tentative structure of my project contains two parts and an epilogue. I am still
uncertain as to what form this research will take, but it will most likely be a combination
of images (still & moving), code and writing. The first part will investigate the 
topology of fiber optics and their role in access to information. I will deepen my study of 
benjamin bratton's work, and Kevin Slavin, notably their interpretation of 
'algorithmic terraforming' -- the virtual world modifying the actual substract
it stands on. Tentatively, I wish to include my friend Ksenia Yurkova's current research at
Helsinki University, and study how her photographic work visually explore
such questions as to manufactured landscape. Out of this initial reasearch, I will be able to create strong theorical
background to build the second part of my research around. I expect to formalize this first
part through code (e.g. a script or program that can be freely used and modified).

The second part of my reasearch will address the collaborative nature of the current
digital culture. I will focus on two main subjects during this part: 
- The advent of git, the open source version control software that has become ubiquitous with open source software
- The indictement and emprisonement of 'Dread Pirate Robert' (FIST LAST), alledged mastermind behind Silk Road

Responding to these two threads, I will introduce  Ben LAST ongoing project of unMonastery, 
along with Mencius Moldbug (Curtis Yarvin) initiative of Urbit.
unMonastery is a network of decentralized workspace & research project that revolve around
unflinching (and almost anarchistic) transparency; Urbit is a free and open source platform 
that aims to completely decentralize client/server interactions. Both are within reach
from a common friend. If the scopes permit it, I also want to study how similar
#behaviors# have influenced the queer community in its organization (e.g. fanzines, public gatherings,
survey data). While this might seems like a broad & diffused #enterprise#, the goal here is merely
to assemble real-world example of collaborative behaviors, and how they can have real
tangible impact: these threads should be seen as available facets to explore rather than
checkboxes that need to be filled. I expect this part to consist mostly of interviews and
pictures.
