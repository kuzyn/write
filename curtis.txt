- self expression is the centrat dominant ideology of modern capitalism
- freedom (even individual) could be hidden away from our present day fetishisation of the self
- individualism makes the system of power stronger
- to bring real effect, you need to give yourself to the cause
- be concilient, bring fwd the invisible power structures, don't be obscure
- the left is obsessed with the problem of the individual
- "this is democracy, this is shit. let's deal with it. let's try and oppose it and see how we can end the crisis"
- allow people to feel individual & that they can give themselves to something bigger

additional observation spurred by "do not eat"'s franklin episode about liberalism (2018):

neoliberalism is closer to libetarianism: free market, privatisation, individual responsability. in that sense, what curtis is refering to is mostly neoliberalism. furthermore, his reading of the late eighties russian situation wrt the "hypernormalisation" of systemic failures goes with that interpretation.
