At the show there was a lot of ponytails. I'm at the Highbury/Islington junction now. Luke was in town; I met him in Utrecht, he has been touring with Big Brave across Europe. The Dutch connection. He had to blow BB off to get on tour with Lightning Bolt. They pay more a lot more money. He said that at one show he sold 107 tshirts. His personal best. The show has just ended, I'm listening to Waylon, still. I never really was into Lightning Bolt. I was into Battles (circa Mirrored) and Double Dagger. I don't think that DD was ever big, but they have this  great song called "No Allies" off a good album with some sort of wood monument on the cover. Anyway, Luke put me on the guestlist. He gave me a tshirt too. He's cool. I have a weird crush on his girlfriend, who's also canadian. She's tall, has thights tattoos, is a bit goth and a big lisp.

While I was going at the bar I bumped into this guy who had this white tshirt on:
"yes i love d.i.y:"
do not think
i will go to
your show

There was a lot of ponytails, and guys/girls were in the expected ratio. One of the bartender was nodding his head and had stretchers big enough to put a thump through, and in them had hanging hoops. Disgusting. Like the hoops of a Urban Outfitter magician, except there is no trick and they don't separate. If they do they stink up the place anyway.

I never was into LB. And now I sort of understand why. It is too indulgent for me. They seem like nice guys: I've heard first hand accounts from the boys about Dave being a real gentleman. I think Louis is even doing a drawing serie with him. Anyway, they seem to be as surprised as me that they can live off this, from the look of it. They are greying a bit. And from what I know they never did anything different. It's just him blasting on the drum for an hour while people are going nuts. I coulnd't help but think of Tommy Lee doing a drum solo. It's the same thing, really. And we make fun of Tommy Lee. We make fun of him when he gets stuck upside doing on a rollercoaster build especially for his solo, while the rest of the band is getting their asses sucked. Look it up! Stuck on the "whatever the name of the Seaworld ride is", playing a drum solo.

I alswya thought it was too indudgent for my taste. It's just a guy doing something fast and loud. It's not punk rock, it's skate board. Energy, vapidity. And everyone is fucking white. I mean, our big crush just released a single on the bring of heralding a new and positive social era; I was in Brighton and saw a loud as fuck punk band whose songs were all about gayness and trans love. Is LB really relevant at this point? I feel like people were attenting for the same reason they look at porn movies: to see a guy who is good at what he does enjoy himself doing it, and they freakshow angle.
