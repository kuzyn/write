1 a tattoo that reads "one punch one kill"

2 someone explaning an idea to someone using a napkin to represent a slab of gypsum, floating it in the air, and the other person saying "hmm, turn it"

3 me putting something in a trashbin in the street, the thing falling outside, me picking it up and placing it in the bin then placing every other piece of rubbish that have ever fallen out of that trashbin inside of it
