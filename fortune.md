i had a flash of that unknown girl, stole from the sidewalk
a diagonal
her eyes were a light kaki, like faded wheat when the summer's over
we all live in the city
we all live here

these one off, where do they go?

i remember the guy who took over my job when i quit last year, the end of the rope, distressed etc:
he said "see you in the other life"
the blood of anxiety gouged my eyes
i wanted to tell him to fuck off
then again, maybe that's some good stuff he said, kind of like encouraging.

you look for it, you look for the strain:

i opened my fortune cookie and there is no fortune, i worry but the cookie doesn't know and didn't
really mean it

two weeks later i walked another sidewalk and found a fortune, no cookie
it said:
Ã€ thrilling time is in your immediate future

when you look for omens, you gotta embrace them all
