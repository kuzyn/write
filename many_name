6 get taken by mom
was named sandra
adoptive father's head turns white
he was a client of my mom's dad barbershop
sister was named sandra so name had to change
when 9 my dad got in touch
got her in the summer
two summers in a row
when 12 she left her mom's house;
her step father was abusing her
lived in a closet for six month, finished her classes
called my dad
come and get her
do the paperwork to adopt her
at some point
he sister, the original sandra
danced for a living
protected her as a kid
went completely crazy with schizophrenia
hasn't seen her in a long time
and her mom, hasn't seen her in twenty two years
no words
vowed to never
ever
introduce her kids to her
