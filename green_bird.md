i saw a green bird in the park today
a parrot
on my way to work
it drew circle around trees flying off
for a former pet, it looked free 
reminded me of listening to tatsuro yamashita
first track on "for you"

the sadness piles in
does not cancel other sadness
like a mound of dust
or a moat around the heart

when i came back last night i was muttering
i spat my gum on the table and rolled a cigarette with my jacket still on
then put my head on the table
the forehead
and just wanted to cry for a while but nothing came
so everything went into the pile
and i smoked looking at the park

wondering why is that
that if i don't care about people
i care about myself

remember:
your first site of protest
was your body. your heart beat:
the most paplable chant
you have ever marched to

thanks
