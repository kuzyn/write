It is not an accident that pornos are the most popular genre in movies, or even, the most popular form of entertainement: as a motivator, it create the opportunity to replicate (mime) the action and take part, physically and emotionally, into the action. Watch other type of action, you do not connect with the linearity or the moment in the same way: you are taken out of the present, of what is actual, and recreate in your mind the mimicry that you are witnessing. In watching pornography, we most often than not participate and in this very Videodromesque interaction, create a link between two distant and disjointed actions: the original and the immitation. A close equivalent would be watching cooking shows (also pornographic in many ways) while eating. This pull us in ever more, creating a bond that becomes more corporeal than merely audiovisual. Pornography viewing, in a situation where one might "join" the action through stimulation, is the original virtual reality. It creates an imaginary scene where many characters, real or not, can assemble into a phantasy. Holding your breath as the swimmer swim, touching yourself like in the mirror. All these personal and vivid tunnels, wormholes, from person to videos to persons; hundred of lifetimes andbillions of fucks. Looking into the eyes of someone who's older now, and elsewhere, while you share this moment with them and they with you. You always fuck to the past and they always fuck with the future.
