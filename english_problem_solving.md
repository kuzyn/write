Rather than address the shopfronts being busted open
the shutter business boomed
Rather than understand why there were stabbing
they built cctvs
Rather than take down the empire from within
they funded bbc

There is complaisance, there are cities, there are people
so busy thinking about getting their hand on the shiny bits
that they forget that they live in the trashyard
