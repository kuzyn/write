it's simple really
tell me were it hurts
tell me how
use a common language
that link your pain to mine
any language really

use my warmt
my ringtone
to tell it's me
we build trust

i make you think
of emptying your aunt's apartement after she died
of the way a vowel bent when said
on a particular day
by your 7th grade teacher
of something only you have experienced, in your mind, alone,
since forever

and if you take everyone else
the billions
and put them together
have they felt what you felt?
do they know what you know?
are them, you?

at some point we'll all have that phone number
at some point we'll all wear that shirt
at some point we'll all collapse into each others
and do truth
be truth
