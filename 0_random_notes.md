today i saw a guy at a barber, his face in a green mask
then a guy at the fruit store
his face gnawed by a wine stain

i talke to my mother for an hour
and now i am listening
to the soundtrack of super mario bros two

i keep putting the tile back
the floor has hundred of these small round blue tiles
and one is missing
always was missing
then another one came loose since then
and i keep putting it back
the whole floor is royal blue
glissening
and i put it back
and there is one missing

walking behind a girl after a nice wistful evening of meat and wine and you think that "she will be something" in the narrative but actually she simply walks in front of you forever and you never see here face. she stops at a glass window, check her lipstick. leather boots. keeps walking and you never, ever see her face or know more about her

then you remember the beautiful story of the yogurt and fruits, being compulsively eaten, this "mom" feeling of wholesomeness and how it reassures and pumps dread into your balloon heart. yogurt. curded mother's milk. a very nice still life. a very nice picture of suffering, that looks like a picture of wholesome breakfast

back from where we left off

i am having a beer in front of the ft lauderdale gate, at yul, the day after the muders. there is a lot of peple, none of them seem stressed, but there is a lot of low voiced commenting, knowing glances, etc. i am having a beer in front of the scene because it is such a good scene, locking eyes with people and trying to get some mayhem in.

my first heartache was when meryl got shot by sw

you close your eyes and in the dark of not seeing 
you think that you can tell that something's missing

something was there, not anymore, when you where younger
maybe

every couple of years a layer peels off
something starts aching

we're all try our so, so very best

he turned around and leaned, looking at her and through her and he said
"behind the eyes, baby 
that's were the scars are"

and he looked straight at mariane while the match burned, slowly, like a fuse to his fingers. she looked at him too but not through him, and took a drag of her cigarette.

the match curled and blacked on itself, then on to fishgut's finger.

fishgut had been in and out of prison, he could tell stories. he'd run dope and beat up people and probably killed a few of them too. now that the beach had been deserted, there was only the white crash of the sea and a pyramid of amber. a couple of kids had followed mariane and fishgut that day, probably because not a whole lot was usually going on around in the bushes. that's how fishgut called that place: the bushes. he had been nice to the kid, buying them a few coke and that hard caramel toffee, patting them on the head. good uncle kind of stuff. "how old are you boy?" and he'd grin enough so you'd see the gap between his canine and molar. he was balding a bit, keeping it short. a strong chin. "go buy me a ketchup chip, and get something for you with the change kid".

mariane had like that, how brotherly he was.

The oily cat litter stuck to my booth,
I saw chipped mirrors in the garbage everywhere,
there was a vernissage and I locked eyes with one of the kid,
I walked by my girlfriend's place not wanting to go in,
 
the English went around the world and forced you to learn the language,
now there's a new code,
and there is a new empire:

the weight of data; servitude of the self.
