back from where we left off

i am having a beer in front of the ft lauderdale gate, at yul, the day after the muders. there is a lot of peple, none of them seem stressed, but there is a lot of low voiced commenting, knowing glances, etc. i am having a beer in front of the scene because it is such a good scene, locking eyes with people and trying to get some mayhem in.

my first heartache was when meryl got shot by sw

you close your eyes and in the dark of not seeing 
you think that you can tell that something's missing

something was there, not anymore, when you where younger
maybe

every couple of years a layer peels off
something starts aching

we're all try our so, so very best

he turned around and leaned, looking at her and through her and he said
"behind the eyes, baby 
that's were the scars are"

and he looked straight at mariane while the match burned, slowly, like a fuse to his fingers. she looked at him too but not through him, and took a drag of her cigarette.

the match curled and blacked on itself, then on to fishgut's finger.

fishgut had been in and out of prison, he could tell stories. he'd run dope and beat up people and probably killed a few of them too. now that the beach had been deserted, there was only the white crash of the sea and a pyramid of amber. a couple of kids had followed mariane and fishgut that day, probably because not a whole lot was usually going on around in the bushes. that's how fishgut called that place: the bushes. he had been nice to the kid, buying them a few coke and that hard caramel toffee, patting them on the head. good uncle kind of stuff. "how old are you boy?" and he'd grin enough so you'd see the gap between his canine and molar. he was balding a bit, keeping it short. a strong chin. "go buy me a ketchup chip, and get something for you with the change kid".

mariane had like that, how brotherly he was.

The oily cat litter stuck to my booth,
I saw chipped mirrors in the garbage everywhere,
there was a vernissage and I locked eyes with one of the kid,
I walked by my girlfriend's place not wanting to go in,
 
the English went around the world and forced you to learn the language,
now there's a new code,
and there is a new empire:

the weight of data; servitude of the self.
