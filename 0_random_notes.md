"Mrs. Thatcher will now realise that Britain cannot occupy our country and torture our prisoners and shoot our people in their own streets and get away with it. Today we were unlucky, but remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always. Give Ireland peace and there will be no more war."

is the form even important in an experimental/drone piece? or is the point experimental, both from the maker's
perspective and for the viewer/listener. it is experiential, as in, we read the signs, we try to interpret that
language, but the meaning is different because we haven't agreed to this language. he says rabbit (i.e. show fur)
i hear mink.

what about an alphabet of images? not pictogram or hieroglifs, but something close to the poetics of written asian
language. completely disconnected from form. a traveling to the left means bowl or vessel/container. a blue car means
cereals. a traveling to the left with a blue car in frame means a bowl of cereal.

game idea: you need to write a story. it's a journalism game. your story
needs sourcing, pictures, quotes, etc. there is a "believability" score. there
is a "factual accuracy" score. there is a "street cred" score. there is a "sensational" score. etc. the words
are written, and you decide what to include (i.e. cite a person, or use "a
source familiar with the matter" (accuracy vs street cred))

write about this, as a script, it's a movie really: a public servant didn't go
to work for 10 years. he said he was working remotely but no evidence was found
of that. he had someone punch out in themorning, out at night, the job was some
sort of archivist. instead he created and ran a male brothel, and created a
sexual comic book hero that goes into sexual adventures

walking behind a girl after a nice wistful evening of meat and wine and you think that "she will be something" in the narrative but actually she simply walks in front of you forever and you never see here face. she stops at a glass window, check her lipstick. leather boots. keeps walking and you never, ever see her face or know more about her

then you remember the beautiful story of the yogurt and fruits, being compulsively eaten, this "mom" feeling of wholesomeness and how it reassures and pumps dread into your balloon heart. yogurt. curdled mother's milk. a very nice still life. a very nice picture of suffering, that looks like a picture of wholesome breakfast

back from where we left off

i am having a beer in front of the ft lauderdale gate, at yul, the day after the muders. there is a lot of peple, none of them seem stressed, but there is a lot of low voiced commenting, knowing glances, etc. i am having a beer in front of the scene because it is such a good scene, locking eyes with people and trying to get some mayhem in.

my first heartache was when meryl got shot by sniperwolf
second was when aeris was killed by sephiroth
third when my first girldfriend broke up

you close your eyes and in the dark of not seeing 
you think that you can tell that something's missing

something was there, not anymore, when you where younger
maybe

every couple of years a layer peels off
something starts aching

we're all try our so, so very best

he turned around and leaned, looking at her and through her and he said
"behind the eyes, baby 
that's were the scars are"

and he looked straight at mariane while the match burned, slowly, like a fuse to his fingers. she looked at him too but not through him, and took a drag of her cigarette.

the match curled and blacked on itself, then on to fishgut's finger.

fishgut had been in and out of prison, he could tell stories. he'd run dope and beat up people and probably killed a few of them too. now that the beach had been deserted, there was only the white crash of the sea and a pyramid of amber. a couple of kids had followed mariane and fishgut that day, probably because not a whole lot was usually going on around in the bushes. that's how fishgut called that place: the bushes. he had been nice to the kid, buying them a few cake and that hard caramel toffee, patting them on the head. good uncle kind of stuff. "how old are you boy?" and he'd grin enough so you'd see the gap between his canine and molar. he was balding a bit, keeping it short. a strong chin. "go buy me a ketchup chip, and get something for you with the change kid".

mariane had like that, how brotherly he was.

The oily cat litter stuck to my booth,
I saw chipped mirrors in the garbage everywhere,
there was a vernissage and I locked eyes with one of the kid,
I walked by my girlfriend's place not wanting to go in,
