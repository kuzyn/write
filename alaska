she had long black plastic nails and some complicated tatoos or percings
i saw them as she was pouring coffee
her smile was dull, like she knew how to move the muscles but not how to smile
and she had flat teeth, but also a great set of canines

conan said that he had seen her on tinder
that she was into hard stuff and that he felt strange knowing so much about someone's private life
he had said that her cat looked a lot like his, but younger and with bigger eyes
i saw it a few days later
real big eyes alright
i petted it until it bit my hand
that's how it all started

i was smoking a cigarette on the backporch a few days later and saw her walking in the alley
she was going from planters to planters eating stuff
later i went down and i saw there were tomatos and strawberries in there

another time i walked in front of her place, we were second or third door neighboors
and she kept a big pile of candles in front, easy to spot
and I had also seen her hang there, with a one-piece that was black
with skeleton bones printed all over it, and a hoodie

so i knew where she lived
and at some point i peeked inside while on my way to buy smokes
the living room had these big posters, lots of lines, triangles, that sort of stuff
maybe pentagrams and skulls, i wasn't sure

then i guess the real thing that made it was that one morning
i went to the bakery to get some stuff for breakfast
it was nice, sunny outside
i was walking
and i saw the cat with the big eyes
her cat
and it was trying to eat a small yellow bird

so i got in between them and pulled the canary away
the bird was all messed up; the cat was really going at it
i went to the bakery with the bird in my pocket, got coffee too
when i got back took it out of my pocket and showed it to conan, and he took a picture
in my room, i flipped a colander over and that was the cage
i fed it a piece of banana, put some water in there too

sometimes i'd pop the colander up, and it'd get scared
try to fly with it's wings all busted
i could see the skin, maybe even some bones
it'd fall to the floor and look up

later that day,
i went to a couple of pet store, bought some bird feed
also bought a milk crate and some other stuff
layed it out on a couple of magazine pages and that was the new cage
the permanent cage

the bird made sounds
not singing, but not silence
it sorta hopped a bit, ate the seeds and the banana
the wings where bad mangled though

that night, i put a cloth on the milkcrate
that's how birds sleep, i think
it covered the milkcrate perfectly, all cozy
but when i woke up the next morning
the bird was dead
it looked all tired
poor thing

i sort of decided that i would bury it
i couldn't just throw it in the trash
it seemed wrong
so i wrapped it in a couple more pages from the magazine
closed it with some tape and put it in my jacket
when i got out i sort of forgot about it

i was going to see this kleber mendoza filho film
then i remembered, yeah, the bird

i was downtown by then
i looked around the cinemateque for an opening in the ground
they were renovating the building, lots of work done
but didn't find anywhere where i could easily throw the bird
it was raining a lot that night, that was after the nice sunny day
i wanted to nudge it into the ground
but in a pinch throwing it would have done

so i sort of gave up and just went in and watched the movie with the bird in my pocket
i thought little buddy got to see a nice film before being buried
well, at least he got to hear it
and also, i felt like i was hanging out with a friend too
so it felt right to me
i love watching movies alone, but i make exceptions sometime

so on the way back, i came out of jarry and went straight to st-denis
walking south
the whole place is gutted, it look like a bomb exploded
so much work going on, replacing the pipes or the sewers or whatever they do
all over montreal
a goddamn bomb

so then it was raining and i had this little bird, this little canary in by coat pocket, the inside one,
and i'm walking down the street trying to find a place dug up for my little buddy,
i figure, the way things are in montreal that's a proper burial:
right in the guts of the street

so i see this tree that they haven't cut down, and there's some earth and some mulch
and i dig with my little paws and get the package with the bird in there
and i cover it with earth
and i make sure it is hidden with leaves and branches

so from now on and for a while, maybe until they gut the street again
if your are on st-denis and villeray
on the north-east corner
there is a little bird burried next to the second tree
that little bird saw bacarau with me
it was murdered by the cat with big eyes
who's owner might be into witchcraft but maybe not

i walked by today, and she was on the porch, we waved and smiled at eachother
i walked by today, and the cat wouldn't stop purring and zigzaggin through my legs

on one hand, i'm very naive
on the other, it's hard to believe in coincidences
