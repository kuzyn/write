political systems are very close to game system. sets of rules, sets of actors, sets of environements. parameters. however, games can be easily updated. games are worlds that can be altered, patched, corrected. of course political systems as well, but much more forcefully, since they encompass all other smaller system. second guessing political arrangements equate to setting in motion the falll of dominos. it is the equivalent of second guessing facts that you have taken for granted, second guessing faith if you have it, second guessing the roundness of earth.

this resistance makes it hard to revise the system, to reform for good. not because of partisanship, i think, but because of how disturbing it is to cross such a fundamental construct of your indivisual experience up to that point

but what happen when the system was designed with bugs?
