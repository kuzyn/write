what i remember is stepping in shit a lot, and trying not to. asking you to cuddle. pulling your hair hard, a saw a grey hair. you had beautiful freckles and you said that lime juice had stained your face. your were so gorgeous that i had to stop myself twice telling you, because i didn't want to freak you out. you spoke and screamed and whimpered in your sleep. we smoked too many cigarettes and leaned on each other a lot. you didn't watch the world cup semi final.

i remember that you washed my hair and it felt very good
