no podcast will help you where we are going
the the land of lost determinants 
and very hard Rs 
and reversed word order
and extra words for no reason
and slurry pronunciation

"je suis prÃªt" was the slogan for the provincial liberal party sometime when I was kid
ready to roll
and beg

they got nuked after that
the voters nuked 'em
but it took about 8 years
and they-we replaced him with a garbage woman
for a few months
rotten to the core

i must have voted, but can't remember

at least she was the first woman prime minister
she droned about "pur laine" and national pride
that's enough for puke and puke on top and run
she got nuked so bad!
worst than the other guy
historical nuke

if i voted, I'm sure I voted for the good side, whatever that was

then quebec elected a man
who simply
looks like the most accurate
reincarnation
of
a beaver

he was (also) the minister of health
for the guy who was "ready" ten years ago

those guys SUCKS!
